**In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?**

A VPS is a virtualized server that is hosted on a shared server. VPS is advantageous in that it allows average joes like us to set up a server without actually having to own a physical server and maintain it. For example, if I wanted to make a website, I could just rent space from professionals who actually manages/maintains servers.
